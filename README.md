## Installation & Setup üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or later
* Node.js (for frontend dependencies)
* FFmpeg (for audio processing)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/imagine-ai.git](https://github.com/your-username/imagine-ai.git)
